# Simple Calculator in C++

This repository contains a basic command-line calculator implemented in C++. The calculator allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered via standard input.

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. This program supports compilers that are compatible with C++11 or later standards.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator-cpp.git
   cd simple-calculator-cpp
 

2. Compile the program using your C++ compiler:
   g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp
  

### Usage

1. Run the compiled executable:
   ./calculator


2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Enter the first number.
   - Enter the second number.
   - Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) or enter `'q'` to quit.
   - The program will display the result of the operation or an error message if applicable.
